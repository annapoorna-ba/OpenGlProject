# Sorting-Visualization
Project demonstrates the Selection sort algorithm visualization. Once we compile and run the program on terminal we get the output screen which includes menu. The array inputs are represented in the form of bars and the size of each bar depends on its corresponding value in the input array.
Functionalities implemented are:
1.Keyboard interface
2.Mouse interface
3.Menu options

To run the file

open terminal and run below command
g++ PgmName.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut

after above command object file will be created then run

./a.out
